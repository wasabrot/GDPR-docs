# What are we doing with your data?

## How we use your data
We only collect data which are needed to fullfill out anti-money-laundering obligations and which help us 
to improve our platform and our services. Here are the 
functions and tasks where your data is used: 

- Verify your identity and your location
- Constantly matching names against sanction, terror and PEP lists (in short: AML lists) to keep your transactions safe 
- Verify that your bank account is plausible
- Product improvements
- Customer support


## Third parties use or store your data
- KYC Spider (holds the AML lists)
- Google analytics and cloud infrastucture 
- Gmail for mail communication
- Apple or Google might have data if you use their browser or phone devices.
- uPort and Consensys - they are the provider of uPort. They do not have access to your data nor can read it. 
Anyhow they might gather information from your internet traffic when downloading or using the app. 


## When is data collected?
- Browsing our website and using our platform
- You send a wire-transfer to us
- When you log in
- When your name is related to a (true or false) positive match with the AML lists
- We have to keep your files for 10 years for reviews
- The "right to forget" is therefore only applicable to our "work data", not to our historical data. 
- Anyhow we divide the "working data" from the "historic data"


## What is stored on the public blockchain?
- There are no names stored on the blockchain by us 
- All personal data is encrypted on the blockchain. Data attached to uPort ist encrypted by your 
very own key where even we dont have access. 
- Other times we use our keys, so nobody else has access. 
- Transactions are represented by adresses not names. 


## What are attestations?
- As you get successfully identified, we somehow "stamp your passport"
- This means that we add an attestion to our identity, which is managed by the [uPort](uport.me) system.


## Which data can a third party application (or Dapp) get from us?
- None. We do not share data, because personal data and attestations are "decentralized" and need you to be shared. 
- You get a request from a third party to give access to your data, which is protected by your private keys. 
- Only if you allow that, a third party can read our attestation among other information you are happy to share.  

## User rights
- See data collected on you - but we are not allowed to tell you the result of the anti-money-laundering checks
- Delete collected data in the "working data" set but not historic data set
- Rectify data we have in the "working data" set but not historic data set
- Opt-out of marketing communication

## How do we delete data on the blockchain?
- We don't because we can't. But that does not matter, because the data is not readable. 
- Private keys protect your data. If you loose or destroy the keys, it is similar to deleting data.
